# -- G4-based hit level detector simulation
# -- digitization (electronics readout modeling)

# -- psim (vtx smearing + G4 sim)

# please note the IMPORTANT: 
# in order to operate Digis, one needs to include Mixing module 
# (pileup modeling), at least in the 0-pileup mode
#
# There're 3 possible configurations of the Mixing module :
# no-pileup, low luminosity pileup, and high luminosity pileup
#
# they come, respectively, through the 3 config fragments below
#
# *each* config returns label "mix"; thus you canNOT have them
# all together in the same configuration, but only one !!!
